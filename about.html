    <h2>Hello!</h2>

    <div id="bio">
      <div class="bioPar">
	I'm Giulio.

	I'm from Italy and I'm currently a PhD student in analytic
 	philosophy at the University of Barcelona. In my academy
 	research, I study what value is. Some of my work has been
 	published in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/theo.12296">Theoria</a>
 	and Synthese (forthcoming!).
      </div>

      <div class="bioPar">
	I've been in close contact with computers since young age —
	when I was around twelve I built a website with photos and
	videos of me and my friends skateboarding —,
	but it was only around 2015, when I was taking a break from
	philosophy and my English was finally pretty good, that I
	started studying programming seriously.
      </div>
      
      <div class="bioPar">
	I first attended Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science
	(CS50) online. Completing it was tough but extremely
	satisfying. Since then, even if I ended up continuing my
	academic path, I have never stopped learning about computers
	and programming.
      </div>

      <div class="bioPar">
	I'm excited about software that can allow different people to
	interact fruitfully, knowledge-sharing platforms, and software
	that can assist individuals in their intellectual and artistic
	efforts.

	A big part of the fascination that software has over me is due
	to Free and Open Source Software and, in particular, to Emacs,
	which I use daily and has had a huge impact on the way I have
	conducted my academic research.
      </div>

	   Have a look at my <a href="./projects.html">projects</a>. I
	   look forward to hearing your thoughts!
