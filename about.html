    <h2>Hello!</h2>

    <div id="bio">
      <div class="bioPar">
	I'm Giulio.

	I'm from Italy and I'm currently a PhD student in analytic
 	philosophy at the University of Barcelona. In my academy
 	research, I study what value is. Some of my work has been
 	published in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/theo.12296">Theoria</a>
 	and Synthese (forthcoming!) and I have presented it at the
 	<a href="https://users.ox.ac.uk/~gradconf/index.shtml">25th Oxford Philosophy Graduate Conference</a>.
      </div>

      <div class="bioPar">
	I've been in close contact with computers since young age —
	when I was around twelve I built a website with photos and
	videos of me and my friends skateboarding —,
	but it was only around 2015, when my English was finally
	pretty good and I was taking a break from philosophy, that I
	started studying programming seriously.
      </div>
      
      <div class="bioPar">
	I first attended Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science
	(CS50) online. It was a quite tough introduction, but also
	extremely satisfying. Since then, even if I ended up
	continuing my academic path, I have never stopped learning
	about computers and programming.
      </div>

      <div class="bioPar">
	I'm currently looking for opportunities as a software engineer
	(full-time or part-time). I would love to work in a place
	where I could be mentored by skilled engineers and learn
	deeply about web development and networking as well as lower
	level programming.
      </div>

      <div class="bioPar">
	I'm excited about software in general, but, in particular,
	about software that can allow different people to interact
	fruitfully, knowledge-sharing platforms, and software that can
	assist individuals in their intellectual, artistic, and also
	physical, efforts.

	A big part of the fascination that software has over me is due
	to Free and Open Source Software and, in particular, to Emacs,
	which I use daily and has had a huge impact on the way I have
	conducted my academic research.
      </div>

	   Have a look at my <a href="./projects.html">projects</a>. I
	   look forward to hearing your thoughts!
